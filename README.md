- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @amerrika
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in frontend web development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning html, css and javascript
-  My current knowledge of javascript is very basic:
    - defining variables (scope, hoisting)
    - defining functions
    - using for loop and while loop
    - using event listeners
    - understanding callback functions
    - working with input fields, numbers, strings
    - doing simple math calculations
    - basic DOM (add & remove classes, adding new html elements)
